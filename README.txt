Project Title:
TIC TAC TOE GAME
Overview:
This project implements a classic Tic-Tac-Toe game where two players compete on a 3×3 board. The game runs in the console (or GUI depending on your implementation) and checks all winning conditions automatically. Players take turns marking their chosen positions, and the program announces the winner or a draw at the end of the match.

Features:
Two-player gameplay
3×3 grid board
Input validation for invalid moves
Automatic win detection
Draw detection when the board is full
Option to restart the game
